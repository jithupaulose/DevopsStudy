 GitHub for Code Management 
 Splunk for Log Consolidation
 Jira for Release Planning
 Harness/UCD for Deployment
 Concourse/Jenkins for Continuous Integration
 SonarQube for Static Code Analysis
 Rocket.Chat for persistent team collaboration
 Start DevOps Handbook book club
 Develop continuous improvement (CI) mindset
 New Relic for Application Performance Monitoring
-------------------------------------------------------
Version control everything (GitHub)
Code to trunk (GitHub)
Use Pull requests and automated code quality checks (GitHub, SonarQube)
Practice Continuous Integration (Jenkins, Concourse)
Use test automation, get tests to green, trust in automation
Decouple application from dependencies
Automate development pipeline
Monitor test environments and production (New Relic, Splunk) 
Automate code and data deployments (Harness/UCD)
Implement dark launching to mitigate dependencies
Use canary releases and blue/green deployments to minimize risk
Release code when ready/certified (Harness/UCD)
--------------------------------------------------------
Implement Poly-skilling (dev/test pairing)
Team takes ownership for all steps in their pipeline (performance testing, security testing, deployment) 
Push pipeline health issues to Rocket.Chat 
Use chat bots to minimize context  switching (Rocket.Chat)
Define done to mean ready to deploy to production  (UAT, perf, security testing all done even if card is being dark launched) 
Use visual dashboards for entire value stream to identify blockers and wait states
Map value stream and understand constraints, to drive CI
Use lead time metrics, MTTR, frequency of deployment and change rate success to identify CI opportunities
-------------------------------------------------------
Implement Continuous Delivery (have the ability to release multiple times per day or week) 
Implement ChatOps (Rocket.Chat)
Business partners deliver work in small batch sizes leading to single piece flow
Business partners execute changes as experiments (MMP, drive change based off of user feedback, capture and act on metrics) 
Automate production validation
Automate feedback loop from production driving improvements in MTTR
