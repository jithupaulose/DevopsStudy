Devops Study:

What is DEVOPS:

DEVOPS are a set of best practices  that combines SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT & IT OPERATIONS together to shorten SLDC(Software Development Life Cycle) and to deliver quality softwares.

Key principles include : collabration, automation, CI - Continous Integration, CD - Continous Delivery & Deployment, Feedback loops

Components of CI/CD pipeline:

SOURCE CONTROL
BUILD AUTOMATION
AUTOMATED TESTING
DELIVER
DEPLOY
MONITORING

Configuration Management maintain a constitency of the system configuration accross the entire SLDC. It involves tracking and controlling changes in infrastructure, code, app configuration to ensure each enviornement stable and reproducible.


IAAC -- Infrastructure As Code
Process of managing and provisioning the infrastrasture through code. Instead of manaual process, devops team can automate the setup, deployment and management configuration using tools like Terraform, Ansible, and chef


Containerization:
It is a process of packing the application along with its dependencies and configuration into a single lightweight portable container that allow constitency and reproduciable deployment accross differnet environment.
It help faster deployment, better resource utilization, easier scaling

Monolith Vs Micorservice Architecture:

Monolith is a single tiered software application where all components and servics are combined in a single unit. Tighly coupled with each other. It is easier to deploy.

Microservice is comprises of multiple loosly coupled services joined together in which all the services can easily deployed, scaled, developed independently. It provide Scalability, Manintainability, Fault Tolerence


LOGGING AND MONITORING:

They are essential for maintaining health and performance of a DevOps Environment
Monitoring - Collecting, processing, analysing the perfornace metrics and system health indicators in realtime or near-real time to identify the issue such as bottlenecks, resource constraints, potential failure, predictive maintaenace. Promethious, Grafana, AppDynamics, Datalog, New Relic
Logging - recording events, messages, errors and other relevant data generated by application and infrastructure components. for troubleshooting and analysis, debugging and understand the behavior of the system. It help to identify the pattterns and anomalities and root cause of the issue . ELK stack, Kibana, Splunk

Most popular tools:

Version Control : Github, GIT
CI - Jenkins, Travis CI
Configuration Management - Ansible, chef, puppet
Containarization : Docker , Kubernetes
IAAS - TerraForm, CloudFormation
Monitoring And Logging : Prometus, ELK stack , Splunk, Grafna, Datalog
